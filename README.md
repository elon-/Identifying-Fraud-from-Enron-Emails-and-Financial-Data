### INTRODUCTION:
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data form its executives.

In this project I will try to use machine learning with sklearn to train my model to find if a person might be involved in the fraud or not. Our sample data is collection of data from the email and financial information of the people who has committed the fraud and people who did not. The sample will be put into various machine algorithms and the results are interpreted and the best model is chosen.
